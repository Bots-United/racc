There are too many people to thank in this file. People who helped RACC to be,
you know who you are. Let me simply tell you that I don't forget any of you.

Especially thank you my developer friends, and thank you people who support
me morally, and those supporting me better than morally. You know who you are,
thank you.

This is still the beginning.
