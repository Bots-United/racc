I would like to thank some people. Without them those bots wouldn't be what
they are now.

- People at Valve that coded the best game of the world...
- Loic 'sgt. Garner' Garnier, for making me discover Half-Life / Opposing
  Force (massn rules, sergeant !)
- Jeffrey 'botman' Broome, for opening the source of his HPB template and for
  all his help to all my newbie's questions on his forum.
- William van den Sterren at CGF-AI for the precious AI-related documentation
  available on his links page. Really worth a look (his whole work too).
- Eric Bieschke, Brendan 'Spyro' McCarthy and Alistair 'eLiTe' Stewart for
  opening the source of their respective bots. Nice work, guys...
- Count Floyd for his guru advices, his time and some useful ideas we lately
  have exchanged by email. This is a person really worth to talk with.
- Cheesemonster for teaching me how to deal with my stack overflows, Bluesy
  and a$3.1415r1n for helping me pointing out some weird bugs in the code.
- Stefan, Tub, Tobias for their helpful advices (well... I'm thanking a whole
  bunch of bot authors here ! Nice work guys, btw)
- Richard Greenlees for correcting my mistakes in the english bot chat files
  translation I had made earlier (it was not that bad, in fact...)
- STICazzi-Slayer for providing me the Italian sound samples and for the text
  chat Italian translation, as well as a complete theory about bot emotions :)
- Ezamudin for providing the Barney-like English sound samples for the bots,
  and for some interesting discussions we had by email.
- The Frantic Flintstones I kept listening again and again and again when I
  started coding, as they were the only MP3s I had on my hard drive.
- 'Gabor' (gabor.cs-fusion.com), for his fantastic woman models, the two
  female hostages in Counter-Strike and the cute 'Salma'.
- Julien 'jude' Perrotteau, for submitting me many ideas (too much at once),
  and for still camping with the crossbow after 1 hour gameplay.
- Jocelyn 'junior' Perrotteau, for doing heavy maths on his hospital bed in
  order to help my bots shoot grenades correctly.
- All the core members of my play team : Phepher (you can't beat this one
  with a machinegun), Jude (the worst sneaky enemy one could have), Joyce
  (tactical master at warpath: "rush to the 4!!"), LeeLoo (she's always here
  where you didn't thought she was), Karine (heavy forestry worker with a
  machinegun too), Anthony (did you ever know what a real sniper is ?), Nono
  (she's kinda stealthy newbie on the maps, pretty efficient sometimes...)
  Plus all those I forgot.

Storm the front !
