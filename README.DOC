Rational Autonomous Cybernetic Commandos AI Source Code Template
Version 1

Huge thanks go to Botman and his HPB code!

This source code is provided as an example of how to create a bot for MODs
for the game Half-Life by Valve software. The use of this source code is
unrestricted as long as you provide credit to Botman in any ReadMe.txt file
distributed with your bot or MOD and also on any website that is used to
distribute your bot or MOD. The source code included here will allow you to
add a bot to the Counter-Strike MOD, and to build a bot DLL file for the
Windows version of Half-Life. Very little work remain to do in the template
source code in order to build a Linux version.


To run the bot on a Windows machine, you will need the full retail version
of Half-Life and the Counter-Strike MOD, or Counter-Strike retail. The demo
version of Half-Life will not allow you to run a bot or any MOD. If you intend
to use this source code to build a full-featured bot, you will also need quite
a powerful machine, since the sensing AI is quite CPU-intensive.

You will need Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (available for purchase from
www.microsoft.com) to rebuild the bot. You'll need to open the RACC.dsw
workspace file in the release/ directory then use "Build->Rebuild All" to
build the racc.dll file for each MOD the bot supports. If you intend to
finish porting the template source code to GNU/Linux, you'll need an egcs
compiler version able to build the Half-Life SDK.
