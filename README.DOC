For the impatient, run the install.bat batch script provided with this
distribution, launch half-life, create a LAN game, set the max number of
players, and enjoy.

This source code is provided as an example of how to create a bot for MODs
for the game Half-Life by Valve software. The use of this source code is
unrestricted as long as you provide credit to Botman in any ReadMe.txt file
distributed with your bot or MOD and also on any website that is used to
distribute your bot or MOD. The source code included here will allow you to
add a bot to Half-Life deathmatch, Gearbox's Opposing Force MOD, Counter-
Strike, Azure Sheep, Valve's Deathmatch Classic and the Team Fortress
Classic MOD. This source code allows you to build a bot DLL file for the
Windows version of Half-Life only.


To run the bot on a Windows machine, you will need the full retail version
of Half-Life, Team Fortress Classic, Counter-Strike, Deathmatch Classic or
Opposing Force. The demo version of Half-Life will not allow you to run a
bot or any MOD. You will also need quite a powerful machine, as the AI is
quite CPU-intensive. At least 500 MHz for enjoyable gameplay.


Before going any further, please be sure to check out the following files:
   LICENSE.DOC - RACC License (BSD License)
   THANKS.DOC - Credits to people who helped the project
   TRANS.DOC - Notes about RACC voice chat translation
   SERVER.DOC - Server administration notes (commands, CVARs, Metamod...)
The html subdirectory contains also other documentation about the bot, as
well as the complete RACC pages.


You will need Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (available for purchase from
www.microsoft.com) to rebuild the bot. You'll need to open the RACC.dsw
workspace file in the release/ directory then use "Build->Rebuild All" to
build the racc.dll file for each flavor of the bot.
