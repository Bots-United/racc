A few words about RACC voice translating

Voice translating for RACC is an easy task for localized versions of Half-Life, i.e. those that don't rely on "scripted sequences" for human grunt voicing. Those versions (as far as I know the French, Italian, German and Spanish version are concerned) have a sound/sentences/ additionnal folder in their valve/pak0.pak packaged file, containing the translated version of the scripted grunt sequences below.

All these sequences have their equivalent translation in a waveform sample in the sound/sentences/ directory. For example, the scripted sequence that says "we will kick your ass!", named !HG_TAUNT2, has an equivalent in the file sound/sentences/hg_taunt2.wav.
In order to have the RACC bots speak your language, you'll have to retrieve all these files, identify their content, then you'll need to sort them in each of the twelve following folders, that correspond to twelve in-game chat situations:

affirmative/ - when the bot acknowledges to an order from one of his teammates
alert/ - when the bot sees or hear an enemy and wants to notify his team of that
attacking/ - when the bot engages combat against one or more enemies
firstspawn/ - when the bots speaks at respawning at each start of a new mission, or after a death when he lives again
inposition/ - when the bot acknowledges to a "stay in position" order from one of his teammates
negative/ - when the bot refuses an order from one of his teammates
report/ - when the bot issues a "check in" order to his squad members
reporting/ - when the bot replies to a "check in" order from one of his squad members and has no threat in sight
seegrenade/ - when the bot sees an incoming enemy grenade and yells at his team to take coverage
takingdamage/ - when the bot is being hurt during a battle and has to continue the combat
throwgrenade/ - when the bot throws a grenade at his enemies and tells his team to step back and take coverage
victory/ - when the bot's enemy is dead and the bot wants to notify his team about it

There must be the EXACT SAME number of files between directories of all translations, with the SAME name. You may have to edit some samples to make them best fit your needs. For instance, much of the victory/ samples come from another file hgrunt/c0a4_ambush_vox.wav which has been hacked in parts to produce four different samples.

The American/English version of the sounds is a ripoff done by Ezamudin (thank you!) of the standard Barney sounds. They are basically not the same as the grunt sounds. However, if you want to record your own ones, you should try to keep the same tone as the other versions in your chat, e.g. shouting for attack sounds, etc. I would be glad then if you submit them to me, in order to see if they are worth being put into the next release.

Happy talking...
