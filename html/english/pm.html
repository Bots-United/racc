        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like (in a fair mess) : art, books, philosophy, music, Italian bikes (foremost Ducati), two-stroke engine preparation, guitar, Jimi Hendrix's blues, rare beers, friends, good huge parties like those we do rarely, gutters after abusing Jack Daniels (man this guy is dangerous), female friendships (the best ones), real mates (they'll recognize themselves for sure, although...), unordinary people, winning lottery tickets, computing, cats, Mylène Farmer (a French singer), psychology (that's to say Mr. Freud and Jung's deliriums), various electronic hacks, trips, Bach's music, big fat wreck rock sound too, a woman's look, cow-boy hats, every people who love someone or something (that's to say I don't like racists like Le Pen) and all those who have something to say when political correctness recommends to shut up.<BR>
