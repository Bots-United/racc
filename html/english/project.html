        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rational Autonomous Cybernetic Commandos (RACC) is a <A href="#WHATSABOT" target="mainframe">bot</A> AI development project which aims at implementing as close as possible a human-like behaviour for NPCs (non-player characters) in first-person shooter games such as <A href="#WHATSHALFLIFE" target="mainframe">Half-Life</A>. The current release of the project supports the following mods: Half-Life, Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force, Azure Sheep, Deathmatch Classic and Counter-Strike (soon War In Europe). The code layout is based on the <A href="http://www.planethalflife.com/botman/hpb_bot.shtml" target="main">HPB</A> template, a work done by <A href="http://www.planethalflife.com/botman" target="main">Botman</A> permitting an efficient interfacing between the Half-Life game engine and almost any MOD DLL. Botman kindly provided his code to the Half-Life coding community, and many developers used it to create their own plugin. Bots are an example.<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The RACC project has been wrote under the <A href="help.html#LICENSE" target="mainframe">BSD License</A>, to allow anyone to use the source code and do whatever he wants with it, provided that the original source of the code is explicitly mentioned in it, i.e. Botman's HPB.<BR>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A href="http://www.planethalflife.com/" target="main">Half-Life</A> is a first-person shooter video game, meaning that the player is viewing the game world by his own character's eyes, this producing an important feeling of realism. The goal of the game for the player is to make use of weapons he collects in the game world to destroy his enemies, which can be computer-controlled monsters (in single player mode) or real player opponents (in multiplayer mode). People can play over the Internet, or in LAN-parties (small temporary dedicated local networks), and so kick friendly ass all night long.<BR>
      </P>
      <P align="left">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A href="http://www.counter-strike.net/" target="main">Counter-Strike</A> is the most famous MOD ("modification" of the game) for Half-Life in which people play with new player models, new guns, new environments, but mostly in a new context. Conter-Strike is a team-based game where terrorists and counter-terrorist teams fight each other. That MOD makes a very great deal of realism, thus headshots and falls from high places are deadly.<BR>

      <P align="left">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bot means robot. A bot is a computer-controlled opponent, with whom people who aren't connected to the Internet or those who just missed the latest LAN-party can train a little, while waiting for the next one. A bot has the same look as a human player, and its AI program is aimed at simulating a normal player's in-game behaviour : fire at you when he sees you, climb at ladders, hide under a staircase while waiting for you, grab items, laugh at you when you are dead, in short all possible & imaginable treacheries like in a true network game. If the bot is good, the player could have the feeling that he is playing against a human opponent.<BR>
      </P>
      <P align="left">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bot's AI is way more complex than the one of the game's standard monsters, which can seem fairly stupid in general. The goal for the developer consists in making his bot think in real time : make him able to identify a wall, a door, his weapon, an enemy firing at him, make him know that if he falls from high he'll probably get some damage, make him able to either go and hide or attack when taken under heavy fire, know which is the best weapon to use in whatever situation, know when to burst-fire, aim accurately or throw a grenade, and a bunch of obvious behaviours that have to be correctly implemented in the AI in an attempt to make his bot if not clever, at least less stupid, again and again.<BR>
