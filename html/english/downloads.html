        <FONT face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><B>PLEASE NOTE</B></FONT><BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <FONT face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">RACC</FONT> project is still in its <FONT face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><B>early stages of development</B></FONT>. It is <FONT face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><B>NOT</B></FONT> a final version. This means that many features are still left to be implemented and that <U>you must not not expect something perfect</U> (yes, it seems obvious as it is, but seeing some e-mails people send me, sometimes it makes me wonder !). Notably the following features are not correctly implemented yet :<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Learning<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Memory<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Emotions<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sense of orientation<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sense of duty<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Auto teamup<BR>
      </P>
      <P align="left">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><B>THIS MEANS</B></FONT> that the fact you don't see those features <FONT face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><B>IS NOT A BUG</B></FONT>. If you don't see the bots rescue the hostages in Counter-Strike, this is <U>normal</U>. If you don't see the bots capture the flag in Team Fortress Classic, this is <U>normal</U>. Let me with enough time to program them, or do it yourself. The source code is available.<BR>
      </P>
      <P align="left">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I want you to keep in mind that comparing these bots with the other waypointed bots is <FONT face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><B>pointless</B></FONT>. Keep in mind that it is a totally <U>different</U> navigation, which attempts to use <U>human</U> techniques.<BR>
      </P>
      <P align="center">
        <FONT color="#FFFFFF" size="-2"><B>The bots sample their field of view in real-time</B></FONT><BR>
        <IMG src="../img/fov-bot-snapshot.png" border="0" alt="The bots sample their field of view in real-time"></IMG><BR>
      </P>
      <P align="left">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><B>THIS MEANS</B></FONT> that their navigation is <FONT face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><B>less good</B></FONT> than those of the <A href="http://www.nuclearbox.com/podbot/" target="main">POD-Bots</A> with whom everybody seems to be willing to compare them with. If you don't see the bots climb the roofs in Counter-Strike, this is <U>normal</U>. If you don't see the bots walk through some difficult areas, this is <U>normal</U>. The power of nowaday's computers does not just allow their artificial intelligence, copied from the human model, to behave as good as those of the waypointed bots, which bots don't even need eyes to follow a path.<BR>
