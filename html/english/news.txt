October 2003

The project goals and methods have been lowered a bit.
I decided to temporarily give up the engine abstraction
method that was causing unacceptable lag, and the work
on the cognitive AI have gone nowhere much further than
conceptual tests. Although all the tests were conclusive,
this work is demanding too much time and is too much
reliant on the rest of the project that everything has
to be ironed out first. Currently problems still remain
with the navigation, but chances are that they will be
solved soon.
The sensitive, motile and memory parts of the AI are
nevertheless terminated (and it works terrificly well).
I have released an updated version of the playable
preview, in which I merged most of the contents of the
template, for coders to have something playable to start
with, and gamers to have an improved version of the still
best waypointless bots. They have anyway so far nothing
really comparable to what the real RACC will be.
As usual, THIS VERSION IS NOT AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. It is
far from being perfect, but hopefully interesting enough
for everybody.
